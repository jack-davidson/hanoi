The towers of Hanoi puzzle is often used as an assignment for Computer Science students.  It demonstrates principles of recursive algorithms and/or stack data structures.  Our purpose is to solve the puzzle with stack data structures.


"The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk."

You may use any algorithm you choose but the towers must be maintained as stacks.
